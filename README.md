Welcome phillrutherford,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

TEA & TOAST

My project was to build a frontend website using html, css and other functions I have learnt up to now on my course. 

I decided to design a website for a cafe, an idea that I have had for several years now. 
For this project I used my new knowledge and understanding of html and css functions.
I also implemented several Bootstrap qualities in order to assist me, along with the help 
of google fonts and font awesome.

UX

For my website I wanted to make the ux friendly for all people. Simple yet effective and appealing
was the main focus. Being a coastal cafe the website needed to be capable of targetting a wide range
audience and given the age of technology it is imperative that the website be all of these things 
across a variety of devices including desktop, ipad and mobile. 

What the main focus of the website is is to generate awareness to my cafe. It was important that the 
website was attractive initally and very easy to navigate, this is why the home page simply has the cafe
name in the middle of the screen in large bold letters, with an easy to use navbar along the top. I 
decided the best way to use the navbar system was to use the help of Bootstrap which allowed me to have
a collapsing navbar when shifted to a mobile device to reduce clutter. I also felt like keeping the website 
strictly on one page would be hugely beneficial also. The aim of the navbar is to direct the user down the page
to the section they wish to view at the simple click of a button. Furthermore the user can simply scroll the 
entire website without difficutly or loading a new page.

I wanted as little external links or downloads as possible to ensure the user remains engaged with the website
The menu and social media features are the only sections where this happens. As the menu was 4 pages in length
I decided a downloadable link was useful as they can thoroughly view the variety of options the cafe offers.
Social media links of course opening a new tab and directing a user to the cafes page is a function I like as 
the user never has to leave the website to do this.

I have attached some samples of my design work an the changes that I made over time as the project ran on.


FEATURES

1 - info alert at the top of the screen. I added this to attract attention to an offer that the cafe is having for the month of June.
I feel having a attractive eye catching offer is good way to start when the user opens a website. Gets their attention and draws them 
into visiting
******change to a warning alert*********

2 - Navbar. The navbar is designed to simply jump the user down the page to the specific section they wish to explore. I find this is 
a very easy to use and user friendly function and allows the user to explore all sections of the site.

3 - background image. I added a slow transition to the background image upon entering the site. I like this feature as I feel its attractive 
and welcoming to the user.

4 - Menu. The download menu section allows users to view and download the cafes menu by simply clicking on the link and not losing their 
location on the site.

5 - social media. The social media links target a new tab to allow the user to visit the pages of the cafe without losing their place on the website.
